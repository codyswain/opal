## Running the Application

To start the application in development mode:

```bash
npm start
```

This will launch the Electron app with hot-reloading enabled.

## Building the Application

To build the application for production (this has not been tested):

```
npm run make
```

This will create distributable packages for your current platform in the `out` directory.

## Project Structure

- `src/`: Source files
  - `components/`: React components
  - `pages/`: Main application pages
  - `styles/`: Styled components and global styles
  - `main.ts`: Electron main process
  - `preload.ts`: Preload script for Electron
  - `renderer.tsx`: Entry point for React application
  - `tests/`: Unit and integration tests

## Testing

The application uses Vitest for testing the build processes and core functionality.

### Running Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
npm test

# Run tests in watch mode during development
npm run test:watch 

# Run tests with UI
npm run test:ui

# Generate test coverage report
npm run test:coverage
```

### Pre-commit Hooks

The project uses Husky to run tests and linting before each commit to ensure code quality. This helps prevent introducing broken code into the repository.

### Continuous Integration

GitHub Actions are configured to run tests automatically on pull requests to the main branch. This helps ensure that all changes pass tests before they are merged.
